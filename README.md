# 8 Puzzle Interface

# About

This is a simple 8 puzzle game using Javascript. The beginning state is randomly generated. It includes a button to scramble the squares and have the puzzle appear when you open the page. You are able to reset the puzzle to a random puzzle whenever the scramble button is pushed.

This program parses arguments from the command line. The program, `testArgs.php`, should exist directly in the `src` directory, while the `ParseArgv.php` class should be in `src/Models/Utilities`.
